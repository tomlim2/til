```js
$ sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules
```

Let’s break it down:

`sudo` means we are running this command as `root`, the system super user. This is because we don’t have permission to write to that folder, but `root` will be able to fix any permission. This command also means the system will ask for your password to confirm.

`chown` is the command we use to change the owner of a file or folder. We set the `-R` option to change the owner recursively, so we also get owner access to all the files already contained in there.

`$USER` is an environment variable automatically set to your username.

And the final piece is the folder path.

Running this path will make the folder yours, so you can safely run your `npm install -g <package>` commands!

Pay attention to the folder listed by the error message. If it’s different, update the `chown` command accordingly.
